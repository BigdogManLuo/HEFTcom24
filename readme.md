This repository contains the code used in the paper **"A Hybrid Strategy for Probabilistic Forecasting and Trading of Aggregated Windâ€“Solar Power: Design and Analysis in HEFTCom2024"**, which details the solutions developed by Team GEB for the [Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition 2024 (HEFTCom2024)](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/hybrid-energy-forecasting-and-trading-competition). Our solutions provide accurate probabilistic forecasts for a hybrid power plant and achieving significant trading revenue.

## Overview

The codebase is structured to reproduce the methodologies described in the paper:

1. **Combined Sister Models** trained on various Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) for wind power forecasting.
2. **Online Post-Processing** model to address distribution shifts caused by increased solar capacity in the online test set.
3. **Probabilistic Aggregation** technique to provide accurate quantile forecasts of total hybrid generation.
4. **Stochastic Trading Strategy** to maximize expected trading revenue considering uncertainties in electricity prices.
5. **End-to-End Learning in Trading** to further enhance the revenue.

## Usage

### Create the Environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate HEFTCom24
```

### Data Preparation

1. Download competition data from [IEEE Dataport](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/hybrid-energy-forecasting-and-trading-competition).

2. Place the downloaded data in `data/raw/` directory.

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

```bash
# Data normalization, feature engineering,  dataset generation for historical/latest scenarios
cd pre-process
python dataPreProcess.py
```

### Model Development

```bash
#Train LightGBM models for dense quantile regression
cd train
python train/train.py

#Train total generation forecasting model
python train/train_total_stacking.py

#Train the stacked multi-source NWPs sister forecasting model
python stacking.py
```

**Noteï¼š** It is necessary to train multiple models corresponding to different quantiles (0.1, 1, 2, â€¦, 99, 99.9) from different NWPs (DWD and GFS), and to train them separately for different data periods (cases). As a result, the model development process **may take several hours**. Pre-trained models are provided in the Release Code for direct testing.
