## Overview

The codebase is structured to reproduce the key methods described in the paper:

1. **Stacking Sister Models** trained on various Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) for wind power forecasting.
2. **Online Post-Processing** model to address distribution shifts caused by increased solar capacity in the online test set.
3. **Probabilistic Aggregation** technique to provide accurate quantile forecasts of total hybrid generation.
4. **Stochastic Trading Strategy** to maximize expected trading revenue considering uncertainties in electricity prices.
5. **End-to-End Learning in Trading** to further enhance the trading revenue.

## Data Preparation

1. Download competition data from [IEEE Dataport](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/hybrid-energy-forecasting-and-trading-competition).

2. Place raw data in `data/raw/` directory

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

```bash
# Data normalization, feature engineering,  dataset generation for historical/latest scenarios
python pre-process/dataPreProcess.py
```

## Model Development

```bash
#Train LightGBM models for dense quantile regression
python train/train.py

#Train total generation forecasting model
python train/train_total_allin1.py
python train/train_total_stacking.py

#Train models that DWD and GFS features are both embedded
python train/train_allin1.py

#Train the stacked multi-source NWPs sister forecasting model
python stacking.py
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning
